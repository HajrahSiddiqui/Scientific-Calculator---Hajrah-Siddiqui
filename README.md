# Scientific-Calculator---Hajrah-Siddiqui
Hello all! This is my scientific - graphing calculator I have made - all my refrences are in the code as well as a README file. I also added additional comments in the code! Enjoy

Overall goal in this project: 
In this program, I strived to create a scientific graphing calculator that not only calculates mathematical operations but also deals with plotting various graphs such as quadratic functions, linear functions, quartic, and more! My end goal was to make a desmos inspired program so that whenever I am in doubt in math I could use this program to solve my equations. This could even work in physics as for graphing I can visualize certain graphs such as a distance time graph or velocity time graph. What is very interesting and fun about how I made this program is that I made it from scratch with only the help of minimul research required. Though it took quite a bit of time I am quite impressed with myself as I have officially made this program proof of any errors the user enters as well as how I managed to even plot the graph of x^89 (try it!!).

All the explanations of the code is located inside

The code starts off with first intorducing the option of either using the scientific or graphing part of the calculator, the scientific part was quite easy to code as it took minimal effort. The scientific part includes the area of a rectangle, triangle, square, and circle where the program solves for it using the equations such as L x w and b x h/2, etc. Once the answer is shown it then stops the program as would a normal calcualtor unless you would want to input another operation. The next part of the scientific part or so math part is that it also takes in two numbers the user enters and asks if they want to multiply, divide, subtract, or add the numbers. 

For the graphing portion it starts off with first asking if they want to input a polynomial function so any equation to the power of anything or a trigonometric function so for instance sin, tan, cos. If the user enters the word poly it takes it through the code of the polynomial function that prompts the user for the equation they would like to input. The program then goes through some complex code (explained in the code bit by bit). It then also offers a question if the function would like to replicate a linear intersection, in my code however I programmed it so the user can input even a quadratic and it will show the intersection not just linear. Then it also offers a question without the intersection. For the trignometric functions sin, tan, cos, it simply offers if the user would like to put an equation to plot it or to replicate itself so how the normal sin cos tan looks like. 

I made every question programmed so that if the user types in a wrong answer or lets say a weird symbol it will say invalid. All my comments and explanations are in code as well as refrences.

Thanks and enjoy the program!
